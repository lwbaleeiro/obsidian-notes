Data structure is a way to organize, store, process and retrieve data. It's a fundamental part of computer science.
Programmers use data structures to improve the speed and strength of algorithms. This combination is known as "DSA" for "data structures and algorithms".

#### Types of data structures:
- **[[Arrays]]:** A linear data structure that stores elements in a fixed size collection.
- **[[LinkedList]]:** A linear data structure that stores elements in nodes linked by pointers.
- [[HashMap]]:  Data structure that stores key-value pairs.
- **[[Graph]]:** A data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.
- **Binary search [[Trees]]:** A node-based binary tree data structure.

### Uses of data structures
Data structures are used in many fields, including computer science, mathematics, and other fields. They can be used to model real-world systems, such as social networks, transportation networks, and computer networks.
